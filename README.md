# Electricity-Online-Bill-Payment
The project is a web-based application where users can get instant  electricity bill and pay them online via credit card. The system automates the  conventional process of paying electricity bill by visiting the place. Users must stand in queue for paying bill and wait for their turn. The process is tiresome and  time consuming. They even have to wait for the bill being delivered to their place  which sometimes can be delivered late by the delivery boy. Hence the system is  developed to automate the electricity bill calculation and payment for user  convenience. The system would be having admin login and user login.
